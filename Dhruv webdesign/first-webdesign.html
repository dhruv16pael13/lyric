<h1> Wake Me Up </h1> 
<h4> By Avicii</h4>

	<br /> 
	Feeling my way through the darkness <br /> 
	Guided by a beating heart <br />
	I can't tell where the journey will end <br />
	But I know where to start <br />
	They tell me I'm too young to understand <br />
	They say I'm caught up in a dream <br />
	Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes <br />
	Well that's fine by me <br /> 
	<br /> 
	So wake me up when it's all over <br />
	When I'm wiser and I'm older <br />
	All this time I was finding myself <br />
	And I didn't know﻿ I was lost <br />
	<br />
	So wake me up when it's all over <br />
	When I'm wiser and I'm older <br />
	All this time I was finding myself <br />
	And I didn't know﻿ I was lost <br />
	<br />
	I tried carrying the weight of the world <br />
	But I only have two hands <br />
	I hope I get the chance to travel the world <br />
	And I don't have any plans <br />
	I wish that I could stay forever this young <br />
	Not afraid to close my eyes <br />
	Life's a game﻿ made for everyone <br />
	And love is a prize <br />
	<br />
	So wake﻿ me up when it's all over <br />
	When I'm wiser and I'm older <br />
	All this time I was finding myself <br />
	And I didn't know I was lost <br /> 
	<br />
	So wake me up when it's all over <br />
	When I'm wiser and I'm older <br />
	All this time I was finding myself <br />
	And I didn't know﻿ I was lost <br />
	<br />
	I didn't know I was lost <br />
	I didn't know I was lost <br />
	I didn't know I was lost <br />
	I didn't know I was lost <br />
